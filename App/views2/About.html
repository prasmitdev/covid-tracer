		<h1>What is the COVID-19 Tracing App?</h1>
		The purpose of this web app is to be able to take a group of people and be able to monitor the spread of COVID-19 among those same people. 
			How it works is that one person registers his or her team to this app. 
			Once signed up they will see overall group health based on how many have contracted COVID-19.
			If one were to contract COVID-19 they would put in who they came into contact with and an email and SMS message would be sent ASAP.
			If there are any questions about the app or something goes wrong feel free to email one of us, our emails are listed below.
